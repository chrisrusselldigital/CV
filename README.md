I'm a passionate digital professional with a breadth and depth of experience. Currently studying software development at Makers Academy. 

Previously my career has focused on digital marketing, including Adwords, SEO and email. Over time, I found myself specialising more and more in analytics and data, as well as the accompanying business change & strategy. Working with developers day-to-day (and having build my first webpage back in 1996) I could no longer resist absorbing myself in code.
